## :page_with_curl: About
This is a project from the Associate Data Scientist career track from DataCamp where 
I applied the knowledge I learned from Data manipulation with Pandas (Course 3) by manipulating, visualizing, and analyzing the New York City (NYC) public school SAT performance.

### The Challenge
Every year, school test results impact the college admissions fate of millions of students.

In this project, you will use standardized test performance data from NYC's public schools to identify the schools with top math results, look at how performance varies by borough, 
and find the city's top ten performing schools!

## :construction: Folder Structure
- `data/`: CSV data from public schools in NYC.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebook. Now it only contains one notebook where the EAD is performed.
- `requirement.txt`: Project dependencies.
- `.gitignore`: Files/paths to be ignored by git.  
- `README.md`: This beautiful readme.

## :wrench: Built With
- [Python](https://docs.python.org)
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org)
- [Matplot](https://matplotlib.org/)

## ðŸ¤” How to Contribute

- Clone the project: `git clone git@github.com:JulianaVelasques/exploring-NYC-public-school-SAT.git`;
- Activate your virtual environment:
  - Linux/Mac: `source env/bin/activate`
  - Windows: `env\Scripts\activate `
- Install the dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`;
- Open Jupyter notebook: `jupyter notebook`;
- Create your branch with your feature: `git checkout -b my-feature`;
- Commit your feature: `git commit -m 'feat: My new feature'`;
- Push to your branch: `git push -u origin my-feature`.

After merging your pull request, you can delete your branch.

## :grin: Notes
This is the second EAD I did all alone without any help, using the knowledge I acquired in course 2 (Data manipulation with pandas) from the Associate Data Scientist career track (DataCamp). 
I had 3 questions to answer about New York City (NYC) public school SAT performance. 
Although the questions were provided, the act of analyzing the data by myself to answer each one helped me to solidify my learning and create a solid beginning toward an amazing and exciting as a Data Scientist career.
It was very satisfactory to investigate the data trying to find:
1. Which NYC schools have the best math results?
2. What are the top 10 performing schools based on the combined SAT scores?
3. Which single borough has the largest standard deviation in the combined SAT score?
I loved doing this exercise and I highly recommend you try it too.
